## Part 1 – Java Snippet

Original code:
```java
public class FileProcessor {
    private static List<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            executor.submit(() -> {
                try {
                    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new
                    FileReader("data.txt"));
                    String line;
                    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                        lines.add(line.toUpperCase());
                    }
                    br.close();
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            });
        }
        executor.shutdown();
        System.out.println("Lines processed: " + lines.size());
    }
}
```

### Response and Classes changed in the project

Java code has several issues related to concurrency, resource management, and best practices.

### 1. Lack of Thread Safety

*   **Problem:** The `ArrayList lines` is a static list shared among multiple threads. `ArrayList` is not thread-safe. When several threads attempt to add elements simultaneously (`lines.add(...)`), this can lead to unpredictable results, such as data loss, line duplication, or even exceptions like `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
*   **Impact:** In a real-world system, this concurrency failure would result in inconsistent data and hard-to-reproduce bugs, compromising application integrity.
*   **Solution:** Use a thread-safe collection. Options include `Vector` or `Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>())`. In the provided code, `Collections.synchronizedList` was used for a simple and effective fix.

### 2. Deficient Resource Management

*   **Problem:** The `br.close()` method was inside the `try` block. If an exception occurred during file reading (`br.readLine()`), `br.close()` would never be reached, leading to a resource leak.
*   **Impact:** Resource leaks can lead to progressive slowdown and total system failure in long-running applications.
*   **Solution:** The best practice is to use the `try-with-resources` statement, introduced in Java 7. It ensures that the resource is automatically and safely closed, regardless of whether the `try` block completes successfully or an exception is thrown.

### 3. `ExecutorService` and `main` Synchronization

*   **Problem:** The code `executor.shutdown()` immediately after task submission, but printed the list size (`System.out.println(...)`) without waiting for all tasks to complete. The `shutdown()` method only initiates the `ExecutorService` shutdown but does not guarantee the completion of running tasks.
*   **Impact:** The program's output would not reflect the correct size, making the result different from expected, thus being a critical failure for a data processing system.
*   **Solution:** It is essential to wait for all tasks to complete. Use `executor.shutdown()` followed by `executor.awaitTermination(timeout, unit)`. This blocks the main thread until all tasks have finished or until the timeout expires.

### 4. Generic Exception Handling (`e.printStackTrace()`)

*   **Problem:** The use of `e.printStackTrace()` in a `catch` block is considered bad practice in production systems. It only prints the stack trace to the standard error output, without a robust error handling mechanism.
*   **Impact:** In production systems, the exception can get lost among other logs without a way to track it, and the application may not be able to retry or log the problem in a monitoring system.
*   **Solution:** For a real system, exception handling should be more sophisticated. At a minimum, the exception should be logged in a structured way (using frameworks like Log4j, SLF4J). The application should also decide whether to continue, stop, or retry based on the nature of the exception.

## Part 2 – C# Snippet

Original code:

```java
public class Downloader
{
    private static List<string> cache = new List<string>();
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        DownloadAsync("https://example.com/data/" + i);
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Downloads started");
    Console.WriteLine("Cache size: " + cache.Count);
}
    private static async Task DownloadAsync(string url)
{
    using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
    {
        var data = await client.GetStringAsync(url);
        cache.Add(data);
    }
}
}

```

### Response and Classes changed in the project

The C# code also presents concurrency and resource management issues, but in the context of asynchronous programming.

### 1. Lack of Awaiting (No `await` usage)

*   **Problem:** The `for` loop in the `Main` method calls `DownloadAsync` but does not use the `await` keyword to wait for each task to complete. `await` is only used within the `DownloadAsync` method. This means the loop fires 10 download tasks in parallel, and the main thread continues its execution immediately. The two `Console.WriteLine` lines will execute before any download completes. The `cache.Count` value will be zero, which is a misleading result.
*   **Impact:** The program does not reflect the expected execution flow and the final state of the system. The output is incorrect and does not represent the actual processing result.
*   **Solution:** The `Main` method needs to wait for all asynchronous tasks to finish. The best way to do this for multiple tasks is by using `Task.WhenAll`. It accepts a collection of tasks and returns a single task that completes when all tasks in the collection have completed.

### 2. Concurrency and `List` (Not thread-safe)

*   **Problem:** The `List<string> cache` is a shared collection among asynchronous threads. Like `ArrayList` in Java, `List<T>` in C# is not thread-safe. Adding items (`cache.Add(data)`) from multiple threads simultaneously can cause race conditions, leading to data corruption or exceptions.
*   **Impact:** Inconsistent data and unpredictable bugs in systems that process information in parallel.
*   **Solution:** Use a thread-safe collection. The ideal class in .NET for this scenario is `ConcurrentBag<T>`, as it is optimized for parallel addition scenarios where order is not strictly important. If order were crucial, `ConcurrentQueue<T>` would be a good option.

### 3. Inefficient `HttpClient` Instantiation

*   **Problem:** The `DownloadAsync` method creates a new instance of `HttpClient` on each call (`new HttpClient()`). `HttpClient` is designed to be instantiated once and reused throughout the application's lifetime, as it manages a connection pool. Creating a new instance for each request is inefficient and can lead to socket exhaustion.
*   **Impact:** In a system with many requests, this can lead to performance issues and failures due to operating system resource exhaustion.
*   **Solution:** The best practice is to create a single static instance of `HttpClient` and reuse it.
